This is a little race game.
Once the game is started six numbers representing horses will appear. 
They will move each time `enter` is pressed. The previous state of the game should disappear, if that is supported by the terminal.

### Installation
rustc and cargo must both be installed. Then simply run `cargo build --release` and then `./target/release/horse-racing` 
in the project directory
